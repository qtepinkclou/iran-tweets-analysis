# iran-tweets-analysis

### The aim of this project is to analyse tweets on the 2022 Iranian Protests. There are various methods used to try and answer following questions:

1. What are the relationships between the most common words (hashtags) used in the tweets?
2. Which time intervals have the most average tweets per day in the dataset and what kind of trend differences does tweets in this interval have when compared to the complete dataset?
3. What is the pre-eminent sentiment/emotion of the tweets in the dataset?

### Libraries used (aside from parts of python standard library) are:

1. `pyvis`
2. `transformers`
3. `scipy`
4. `pandas`
5. `numpy`
6. and self written `Wrangle` class

### Tweets dataset used in analysis created by Konrad [Banachewicz](https://www.kaggle.com/konradb) and can be downloaded from this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/konradb/iran-protests-2022-tweets/versions/82) (version 82)

### Each question has its own `.ipynb` file in `src` which explains the question step by step, as well as a folder containing findings in `results` folder.
